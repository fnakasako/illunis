# Sovereign Attention Protocol (SAP)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Return sovereignty to your attention stream. SAP is a decentralized protocol that enables users to take control of their content consumption through local processing, platform-agnostic filtering, and optional peer-to-peer reputation sharing.

## 🎯 Core Vision

SAP puts you back in control of your attention by providing:
- Local-first content filtering and analysis
- Platform-agnostic content integration
- Privacy-preserving attention tracking
- Optional peer-to-peer reputation sharing

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fnakasako/sovereign-attention-protocol.git
cd sovereign-attention-protocol

# Install dependencies
cargo install --path .

# Run basic content filter
sap filter --source twitter --rules "block:spoilers"

# Track attention metrics
sap track --source youtube
```

## 🔧 Core Components

### Local Processing Engine (LPE)
- Rule-based content filtering

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Is this a replacement for social media platforms?**
A: No, SAP acts as middleware that enhances your existing platform experience while preserving your attention sovereignty.

**Q: Do I need to share my data?**
A: No, SAP is local-first. P2P sharing is completely optional.

**Q: Can I use this with multiple platforms?**
A: Yes, SAP is designed to be platform-agnostic. We're starting with Twitter support and will expand based on community needs.
